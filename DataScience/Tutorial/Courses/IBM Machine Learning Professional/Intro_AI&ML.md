Deep learning is a subset of Machine learning, and Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence.

artificial intelligence is any program that can sense, reason, and act and adapt. 

Machine learning is a subset of that, where it's able to replicate intelligent behavior, but the machine will learn as more data is exposed to it. 
- learn from repeatedly seeing data then being explicitly programmed by humans
- Supervised: have a target column, make predictions, fraud detection
- unsupervised: does not have a target column, find structure of the data, customer segmentation
- limitations in picture because huge amount of pixels

deep learning is a subset of machine learning, which improve as it's exposed to more data, but now specifically to those algorithms which have multi-layered neural networks.
- best representation of original data, in classic machine learning humans must do this
