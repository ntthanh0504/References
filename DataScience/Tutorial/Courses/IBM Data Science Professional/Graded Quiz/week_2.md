### Question 4: How has the interest in data science and business analytics changed over the last few years, and what is the impact on undergraduate courses in this field?

&#x2612; Interest in data science has shifted primarily to parents rather than students.

&#x2612; Interest in data science has declined, leading to a decrease in enrollment in undergraduate courses.

&#x2611; Interest in data science and business analytics has increased, leading to a growing number of students enrolling in related undergraduate courses.

&#x2612; Interest in data science has remained constant, with no significant changes in enrollment in related undergraduate courses.

> Correct! The passage mentions that interest in data science has increased, resulting in more students enrolling in undergraduate courses related to data science and analytics.

### Question 5: Which open-source technology provides distributed storage and processing of big data, allowing scalability and support for various data formats?

&#x2612; Apache Hive

&#x2612; Apache Spark

&#x2612; NoSQL databases

&#x2611; Apache Hadoop

> Correct! Apache Hadoop is the technology described in the passage that provides distributed storage and processing for big data with scalability and support for various data formats.
# Graded Quiz: Deep Learning and Machine Learning

### Question 1: What is the concept that refers to data sets of massive scale, rapid generation, and diverse types that challenge traditional analysis methods like those used in relational databases?

&#x2612; Data mining

&#x2612; Deep learning

&#x2611; Big data

&#x2612; Machine learning

> Correct! Big data refers to data sets that are massive, quickly generated, and varied, challenging traditional analysis methods.

### Question 2: How does Generative AI contribute to addressing the challenges faced by data scientists, researchers, and analysts when exploring significant data patterns and insights?

&#x2612; By speeding up the traditional manual analysis process

&#x2612; By replacing the role of data scientists in analyzing data patterns

&#x2611; By enabling the derivation and evaluation of hypotheses from diverse data sources

&#x2612; By automating the process of collecting and preprocessing data

> Correct! Generative AI helps bridge the gap by allowing the exploration and evaluation of multiple hypotheses from various data sources, enhancing decision-making.

### Question 3: Imagine you’re working with generative AI to create new instances of data that resemble your original dataset’s patterns. Which model would you choose as the foundational deep learning approach for this task?

&#x2612; Neural Networks

&#x2612; Linear Regression

&#x2612; Decision Trees

&#x2611; Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)

> Correct! GANs and VAEs are the deep learning models that form the foundation of generative AI by learning patterns from extensive data and generating new instances.

### Question 4: Which technology is characterized by its ability to learn patterns on its own, such as distinguishing between objects like cats and dogs, and even generating speech that sounds like a learning baby?

&#x2612; Basic Pattern Recognition

&#x2612; Traditional Neural Networks

&#x2611; Deep Learning

&#x2612; Linear Algebra Transformations

> Correct! Deep learning is a technology that allows systems to learn complex patterns and features on their own, even distinguishing between objects and generating speech.
