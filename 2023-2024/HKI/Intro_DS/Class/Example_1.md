**Research Issue:**
Starbucks intends to conduct a study to ascertain if there's a difference in the spending habits of men and women when they visit their stores.

**Data Collection:**
A researcher was hired to gather data from the first 100 customers who visited a Starbucks store in New York City in a single day. The sample consisted of 40 men and 60 women.

**Research Design:**

1. **Sampling Type:** Convenience sampling was used, as the data was collected from the 'first' 100 customers, which is a readily available group.

2. **Sample:** The sample consisted of the first 100 customers who visited the store that day.

3. **Population:** The population is all customers who visit the store in New York City in a day.

4. **Sample Adequacy:** The sample may not be representative of the entire population as it does not account for all characteristics of the population.

5. **Variables:** The independent variable is 'Gender' and the dependent variable is 'Amount Spent'.

6. **Variable Types:** 'Gender' is a nominal variable, while 'Amount Spent' is a continuous variable.

7. **Research Type:** This is a correlational research study.

8. **Statistics and Parameters:** The statistics are the first 100 customers, consisting of forty men and sixty women. The parameters are the customers who visit the store in New York City in a day.

9. **Resampling Suggestions:** To improve performance, consider resampling based on time of day, specific store, day of the week, and season.
